## ❤️ Free-Source Software - Make life easy ⭐️

I am trying to create our day-to-day life easy by automating small / tiny task. In most of all organizations, HR is sending an birthday email with keeping CC to all but we don't want to wish each and everyone. At the same time we also don't want to miss to greet someone whom we knows or to whom we are close. So when you open your email message, you will see `Add-ins` menu and there you can see a button to `Say Happy Birthday`. It will automatically send a birthday greeting email to the one who is in To of that email. When you are trying this very first time, it will ask you to select an Birthday HTML template. If you don't know how to create an html template, then just prepare any beautiful draft in New Email, (don't forget remove your signature) and Save As it as html. It's so simple. It will save that path in future. If you want to reset that then you can click on `Reset Bday Template`.

Hope it helps!
