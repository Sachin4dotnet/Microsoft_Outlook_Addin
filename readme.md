## ❤️ Free-Source Software - Give ⭐️

I have included the awesome `symfony/thanks` composer package as a dev
dependency.
Let your OS package maintainers know you appreciate them by starring
the packages you use.
Simply run `composer thanks` after installing this package.
(And not to worry, since it's a dev-dependency it won't be installed in your
live environment.)
